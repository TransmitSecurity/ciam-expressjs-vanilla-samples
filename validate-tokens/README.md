# Validate tokens to protect your APIs

In case you intend to use Transmit Security access tokens or ID tokens to protect your APIs, you
should validate the access token before you allow access to your API.

We implemented tokens validation in our login-with-email sample. The validation process is based on
the following guide: https://developer.transmitsecurity.com/guides/user/validate_tokens/

To run this example, refer to the [login-with-email](../login-with-email/README.md) example.
